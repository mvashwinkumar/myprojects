                        EXO World has ensured compliance with some of its legal obligations in some 
                        countries in relation to personal information by creating a set of binding 
                        Standards and Policies (known in some countries as binding corporate rules), 
                        approved by a number of national privacy regulators. As a result, depending on 
                        your circumstances and location, you may be able to enforce your privacy rights 
                        using those Standards or Policies through that regulator or a court. If you 
                        would like to know more about these standards and commitments, please contact
